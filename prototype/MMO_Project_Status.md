# 📜 Browser MMO Project: Current State, Planned Features & Next Milestones

## 🚀 Current State (Baseline Milestone 1.5 Complete)

### ✅ Overworld Map
- Generates a **100x100 overworld grid** using `terrainGenerator.js`.
- Base terrain starts as **all water**, then populates:
  - Elliptical land blobs
  - Hot zone rows (40-60) favor deserts / wastelands
  - Polar rows (top & bottom 3) set as polar deserts.
- Adds additional terrain features:
  - **Mountain chains** (elongated elliptical rocky biomes)
  - **Rivers** (meandering from top to bottom)
  - **Swamps** adjacent to water tiles.

### ✅ Persistent Overworld
- Overworld map stored in `localStorage` to ensure continuity across sessions.
- Includes a **Reset World** button which:
  - Clears local storage
  - Regenerates a new overworld map
- All terrain generator functions built to be **modular and extensible**.

### ✅ Static Viewport Scaling
- Viewport is locked to **1080x720**, with the grid automatically scaling to evenly fill the space regardless of overworld size.
- Overworld displayed using a **CSS Grid**, ensuring every tile scales uniformly.

### ✅ Tooltips & Debug
- Hovering over any tile shows a native tooltip with:
  - Coordinates `(x, y)`
  - Terrain type and biome (e.g. `land / forest`, `land / polar desert`).

## 🗺️ Regions (Milestone 2 Baseline Complete)

### ✅ Region Generator
- Clicking a **land tile** on the overworld triggers `renderRegion` which:
  - Generates a **20x20 region map** based on the clicked tile’s biome.
  - Each tile in the region has terrain influenced by the parent biome (e.g. more trees in forests, sand in deserts).
  - Region data is stored inside the overworld tile (`tile.regionMap`) for persistence.

### ✅ Region Rendering
- The region fills a **720x720 grid**, evenly scaling each cell.
- Region tiles display terrain with simple color coding (trees, grass, sand, rock, etc).
- Includes placeholder comments & hooks for future features like:
  - Wildlife spawning
  - Loot placement
  - Generating structures (ruins, villages, dungeons)

## 🌱 Planned Features

### 🧭 Overworld
- Procedural seeds for deterministic overworld generation.
- Weather & climate overlays (future milestone).

### 🏞️ Regions
- Procedural placement of:
  - Structures (e.g. ruins, caves, small towns)
  - Resource nodes (herbs, ores)
  - Wildlife or monster spawns
- Interactive exploration & gathering.

### 🎒 Player Systems
- Persistent player inventory.
- Character attributes & skills influencing exploration.
- Quest hooks tied to region exploration.

### 🗂 Save/Load Systems
- Advanced local storage snapshot system for player state, inventory, explored regions.

## 🔥 Next Milestones

### ✅ Milestone 2 (Region Features)

|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Inventory & Gathering     | Collecting resources directly from regions.      |
| Crafting & Use Items      | Using gathered resources to craft.               |
| Quest Triggers            | Find notes, camps, NPCs that start small quests. |

### 🌐 Milestone 4 (UX Enhancements)
| Feature                   | Description                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Hover Tooltips or UI Panel | Rich overlays on hover (health, loot chances).   |
| Minimap or Map Overlay     | Small minimap showing position.                  |
| Settings / Save Manager    | UI to manage save slots, load, reset.            |

```

## ✅ Technical Highlights
- Uses **CSS Grid** for all rendering, ensuring scalable layouts.
- **All terrain functions are modular**, designed for easy expansion (mountains, rivers, swamps).
- Click-to-drill from overworld → region uses same `#view-port`, keeping architecture clean.
- Debug-friendly with hover tooltips and console logs at every generation step.

## 🚀 Future Notes
✅ Project is set up to **easily extend by dropping in new modules** like:
- `creatureSpawner.js` → spawn monsters in region
- `questHooks.js` → dynamically place quests on map
- `weatherSystem.js` → adjust visuals and terrain interactivity

## ✍️ Your next step
When ready, pick your milestone:
- 🚀 “Let’s build loot placement in regions.”
- 🚀 “Let’s add NPC wildlife to regions.”
