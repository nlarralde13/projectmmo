# 🛠️ Browser MMO — ProtoV2 Kickoff (Phase 2)

✅ **Phase 1 (ProtoV1) Complete:**
- Built initial procedural overworld (100x100) with rivers, mountains, swamps, basic biomes.
- Added CSS Grid renderer and overlay system for zoom views (5x5) and region maps (20x20).
- Modularized key systems: terrainGenerator, overworld.js, zoomView.js, regionGenerator.js.

---

🚀 **Phase 2 (ProtoV2):**
- Formalize file structure for scalability.
- Externalize biome + settlement configs (JSON or DB).
- Re-implement terrain + settlement generation under new architecture.
- Prepare for interactive travel and settlement systems.

---

🗂 **New structure:**
- `/core` → all game systems
- `/ui` → overlays, minimap, tooltips
- `/assets/config` → JSON for biomes, settlements, items
- `/utils` → prng, noise, pathfinding
- `/data` → later: saves, world snapshots

---

💪 **Strategy:**
Refactor piece by piece, migrating files + rewriting where needed for clarity.
